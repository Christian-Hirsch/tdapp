In our paper, we derive a functional central limit theorem for bounded persistent Betti numbers of stationry point patterns in a large observation window. 

We study the effectiveness of tests derived from this result for simulated point pattern. We also illustrate an hypothesis test in the context of a specific data set from neuroscience.
